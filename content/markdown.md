## Paragraphs

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

## Emphasis

I just love **bold text**.

Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.

This is really **_very_** important text.

## Blockquotes

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

## Ordered Lists

1.  First item
2.  Second item

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

3.  Third item
    1.  Indented item
    2.  Indented item
4.  Fourth item

## Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

## Code

    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up

Then you should be able to browse to `localhost:3000` and see the site.
